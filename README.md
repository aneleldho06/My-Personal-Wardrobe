# WardrobeWizard 🪄

**A Sustainable AI-Powered Personal Wardrobe Stylist**  
*Style what you already own — no new purchases required*

</div>

## Project Overview

WardrobeWizard is a mobile-first application that empowers users to create fresh, occasion-appropriate outfits exclusively from their existing wardrobe. By leveraging AI, the app helps reduce clothing waste, promotes mindful consumption, and maximizes the utility of clothes people already own.

**Key Philosophy**  
Sustainability through reuse — encouraging users to rediscover and creatively combine items they already possess instead of purchasing new ones.
