*Style what you already own — no new purchases required*

>Hackathon Wining Project

## Project Overview

WardrobeWizard is a mobile-first application that empowers users to create fresh, occasion-appropriate outfits exclusively from their existing wardrobe. By leveraging AI, the app helps reduce clothing waste, promotes mindful consumption, and maximizes the utility of clothes people already own.

**Key Philosophy**  
Sustainability through reuse — encouraging users to rediscover and creatively combine items they already possess instead of purchasing new ones.

## Potential Improvements & Roadmap

The current version is an MVP focused on core functionality. Planned enhancements include:

**Near-term (1–3 months)**  
- Real-time weather integration for smarter outfit filtering  
- Laundry/clean-dirty status tracking per item  
- "What can I wear with this?" anchor-item mode  
- Outfit favorites & basic calendar/planner  

**Medium-term (3–9 months)**  
- Improved image processing (better auto-tagging & background removal)  
- Low-usage item highlights & gentle reminders  
- Outfit export as shareable images/stories  
- Offline support for basic features  

**Long-term vision**  
- User accounts with cloud sync (persistent wardrobes across devices)  
- Optional second-hand resale integration (ethical affiliate links only)  
- Advanced analytics (cost-per-wear estimation, wardrobe variety score)  
- Multi-profile support (family/shared wardrobes)  

All future features will maintain the core principle: **style only what you already own** — with no pressure to purchase new items.

We are committed to building an ethical, sustainable tool that evolves based on real user feedback.
