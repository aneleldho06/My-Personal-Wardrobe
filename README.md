# WardrobeWizard 🪄👕

Hello! 🌟  
This is a small, kind mobile app that helps you make nice outfits...  
...using **only** the clothes you already have at home.  

No need to buy anything new! ♻️  
Just fun, simple styling with what you own.

## What does the app do? (very easy version)

1. You add your clothes (take photo or choose from gallery) 📸
2. The app remembers your wardrobe
3. You say: "I need outfit for college" or "party tonight"
4. AI friend gives you 3–4 pretty outfit ideas using **your** clothes only 😊
5. You can also ask for a full week plan (7 days of different looks!)

Very useful for students, people who want to save money, or anyone who loves their old clothes 💛

## Screenshots (coming soon!)

Here you can show how the app looks!
